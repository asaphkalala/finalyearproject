# Final year project
Afro Hair Plugin in Autodesk Maya
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract: Hair is an essential part in character design and can go as far to be considered a factor which composes a character's identity. I will be creating a node based, procedural modelling tool, which offers artist friendly controls to procedurally model curly, afro-textured hair. I will be using Autodesk Maya, Python and PyMel, which is Maya’s own scripting language.
